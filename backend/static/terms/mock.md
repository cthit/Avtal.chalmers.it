## Installation (Overly explicit)

1. if you want to use an IDE, we recommend [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows) (We recomend this, especially for Windows users). Which should include a python installation
    - if it does not, install it manually from https://www.python.org/downloads/ or using a package manager 

2. Make sure that you have Git installed on your system if not: 
    - On *Windows* or [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install using the wizard or install a graphical git client *i.e* [Gitkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/).
    - On a Linux based system (or Mac) install using your package manager of choice 

3. Clone the project into your prefered folder. 
    - if using GitKraken follow the instructions after installing
    - if using a Terminal

        `cd <Your preffered folder>`

        `git clone https://github.com/cthit/2d-platform-game-it.git`

### PyCharm Instructions
- Launch PyCharm and follow the setup. Open the project using PyCharm

- Click on configure Python interpreter in the top right corner and add a new environment. 

- Add packages pygame, pillow and numpy by clicking on the + and searching for them

Done!

### Unix Instructions (if not runing PyCharm)

- change directive to game directive: `cd 2d-platform-game-it`

- install pip by running `python3 -m pip install pip` (probably requires root access so run with sudo)

- setup a virtual environment by running 

    `python3 -m venv <game environment>` 

    replace \<game environment\> with what your enviroment should be called. (probably also requires sudo) 

    Run `source <game environment>/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment
- Finally run `pip install pygame pillow numpy`
- You should be now be setup so try running `python3 main.py` if you run into the error no module named src simply run `export PYTHONPATH=.`

Finally if you run into any problem feel free to contact digIT


#### General instructions


## Introduction

The game is built around making it very simple to add new content to the game and is therefore split into a few different parts:

- Tiles:
  - Basic unmovable block in the game world, basically only an image you can collide with.
- Entities:
  - Anything else in the gameworld, such as the player or the goal flag.
- Behaviours:
  - Entities can have behaviours such as Collide, Jump, Move etc.
- Ui (Views & Elements):
  - The ui elements are buttons, text, non-entity images that interacts with the player.

All of these are modifiable in different ways which are described below.

## General Information

### The GameMethods Class

GameMethods is an object that exposes certain methods of the main Game class:

- `play_sound(file_name)` plays a sound from the "resources/sound" folder
- `find_entities(name)` returns all entities of the given name
- `restart_level()` resets the level to its initial state, might be used for example when the player dies.
- `load_next_level()` clears the current level and loads the next
- `get_level_dimensions()` returns a tuple with the dimensions of the current level, `(width, height)`.
- `load_level_by_index()` load a level by its given index
- `spawn_entity(entity, x, y)` spawns an entity (like a bullet, or a coin) into the world at coordinates x and y
- `kill_entity(entity)` removes an entity from the game
- `get_level()` gets the current level object
- `get_previous_level_index()` returns the index of the previous level
- `load_level_lost_screen()` displays the "level failed" screen (generally unused, use player_lost method instead)
- `load_main_menu()` displays the main menu
- `get_last_level_coins()` get number of coins collected in previous level
- `load_level_complete()` displays the "level complete" screen
- `get_player_coins()` returns the current number of coins collected by the player
- `time_left` the time that is left on the current level (0 if it's not enabled for the level)
- `last_level_time_left` the time that was left when the previous level was finished (0 if it wasn't enabled on that level)
- `player_lost(reason_for_death)` loads the level failed screen with the the (string) `reason_for_death` shown as a reason.

### Behaviours

Behaviours are used to define the different behaviours of an entity for example some built in behaviours are:

- **Collide** (The only behaviour used by all entities), allows the entity to collide with other entities or tiles.
- **Fall** makes the entity be affected by gravity.
- **Jump** allows the entity to jump, can be bound to a key press or called by code.
- **Move** allows the entity to move in all directions, can by bound to key presses or called by code
- **Shoot** allows the entity to shoot any kind of other entity. Can be bound to key press or called by code
- **LifeSpan** makes the entity automatically die after a given amount of time
- **KnockBack** allows the entity to be pushed away by other entities
- **Health** makes it possible to damage and kill the entity, can optionally display a healthbar
- **Collector** allow the entity to collect collectibles
- **Collectible** makes the entity into a collectible
- **Ai** give the entity a simple mind of its own. It will try to chase and attack the player

Information about creating new behaviours can be found [here](#creating-new-behaviours).

## Simplest modifications

### Level Creation

To create a new level for the game you simply have to do the following steps:

1. Create a folder with a name of your choosing in the levels folder.
2. Create an .bmp image named map.bmp which will be your level. The game will later spawn entities and tiles according to the pixel values of the image.
3. Add a [config.ini](#config-details) file in the folder containing at least a General tab with a Name and a Index property.
4. (optional!) You can also add a color-map.ini file if you want to use custom entities or tiles in your level. This file needs to contain a [Colors] tag and then a property with the hex value of the color you want to assign to the tile/entity which maps to the tile/entity class name you want.
   ex:

```ini
[Colors]
FF0000 = Player  ; This makes all RED, #FF0000, (255,0,0) pixels on your map.bmp turn into Player entities
```

#### Config details

```ini
[General]
Name = Grass Level
Index = 2
```

The **name** property is simply a name for the level and can be whatever you want to name your level.
The **index** property decides which order the levels come in and can be any number >= 1 (if there are more than one with the same index one of them will be selected by random). 

There are also several other properties and tags which are optional and will be using the default settings if not present.
These are:

**Physics**

```ini
[Physics]
Gravity = 5
```

Gravity is the downwards acceleration that is applied to falling entities in the level (default 9.82) can be negative!
gravity = blockheight/s^2
**Camera**

There are several different camera modes to choose from, but only choose one per level.

**Camera(Static)**

Static is the simplest mode it defines a camera that is fixed in place and size.

```ini
[Camera]
; Static camera mode
Mode = Static
Blocksize = 10
X = 50
X-unit = percent
Y = 20
Y-unit = tiles
```

The blocksize attribute defines how big (in pixels) a single tile should be.

X, X-unit, Y and Y-unit are all properties to define how the camera should be positioned.

X-unit and Y-unit is either "percent" or "tiles" and defines how much the camera should be offset from its default position (centered in the upper left corner of the level.)

The "Percent" unit means percent of the level width (for x) and height (for y).

**Camera(Follow)**

The follow mode centers the camera on an entity in the level.

```ini
[Camera]
; Follow camera mode
Mode = Follow
Target = Player
Blocksize = 10
```

"Target" is the name of the entity on the map. Make sure that there are no more than one such entity on the map. (The camera can, for instance, not follow two player entities simultaneously)

**Camera(Tile)**

The Tile mode divides the level into smaller sections, and the camera focuses on the section containing its target. (Think Super Mario)

```ini
[Camera]
; Tile Camera mode
Mode = Tile
X = 0
X-span = 20
Y = 0
Y-span = 10
Target = Player
```

In the tile mode. Instead of "blocksize", you define how many tiles should be visible height- and width wise.

This is done using the attributes X-span and Y-span.

The X and Y values are used to offset the tiling grid.

##### Pre-Existing Levels

There are a number of levels already in the game so to avoid unintentional index-clashes, here's a list of the currently existing levels by index, note that indexes <= 0 are used for non game-level levels such as menu screens.

- -10: "large_level_test" a testing level used mostly for optimization purposes.
- -4: "level_complete_screen" the screen for when the player has completed a level.
- -3: "level_fail_screen" the screen for when the player has faileda level.
- -2: "loading_screen" the screen that shows up when levels are loaded (often only seen for brief periods of time).
- -1: "win_screen" the screen for when the player has won the game.
- 0: "main_menu" the main menu screen.
- 1: "level1" the first level.
- 2: "level2" the seconds level.
- 3: "level3" the third level.

### Creating new tiles

Creating new tiles is probably the easiest modification you can do to the game altough a custom level is probably required to use the new tiles.

To create a new tile you simply have to create a new folder with the name of the tile (in lowercase letters only) and then put an image with the name of the tile in that folder.
example for tile named Stone:

```
├── tiles
    ├── stone
        └── Stone.png
```

---

## Intermediate Modifications

### Creating new entities

Creating new entities is similar to creating new tiles. You create a folder with the name of the entity (folder name needs to be lowercase only) and it in the /entities folder, then put an image with the name of the entity in that folder. After this you need to put a python file with the name of the entity in the folder.
example for an entity called PowerUp:

```
├── entities
    ├── powerup
        ├── PowerUp.py
        └── PowerUp.png
```

The python file needs to contain a class with the name of the entity and it needs to inherit from the base Entity class or another class that does inherit from the Entity class, for example if you want to create an enemy it's probably a good idea to inherit from the character class. The class constructor also needs to take an x, y and a name which also will need to be passed onto the super constructor.

example for an enemy class:

```python
from entities.character.Character import Character

class Enemy(Character):
    def __init__(self, x, y, name):
        super().__init__(x, y, name)
        ...
```

Entity also have some default methods that can be overriden to add new features to the game most nobable of these is the update method which is called once every frame and looks like this:

```python
def update(self, delta_time, keys, config, game_methods):
    ...
```

- The **delta_time** parameter is the time passed since the last frame and can be used to make sure things run smooth in any framerate, for example for movement you most likely want to multiply the speed with the delta_time to determine the distance to be moved that frame to make sure the movementspeed is consitent every second.
- The **keys** parameter contains information about which keys are currently pressed and originates from pygame.key.get_pressed() more information can be found [here](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html#pygame.key.get_pressed)
- The **config** parameter is the current level's configuration data from its config.ini, this is useful for things like getting the current gravity or if you want to add/use your own level-unique configs.
- The **game_methods** object contains methods related to the entire game. More information about the GameMethods class can be found [here](#the-gamemethods-class).

The entity class has the following properties:

- `deletion_pending` a boolean that if set to `True` will remove the entity in the next update.
- `is_dead` prevents the entity from doing anything if set to True
- `spawn_x` the x spawn position of the entity.
- `spawn_y` the y spawn position of the entity.
- `x` the current x position of the entity. (use set_x to modify, otherwise collision won't be updated)
- `y` the current y position of the entity. (use set_y to modify, otherwise collision won't be updated)
- `width` the width of the entity. (use set_width to modify, otherwise collision won't be updated)
- `height` the height of the entity. (use set_height to modify, otherwise collision won't be updated)
- `behaviours` a dictionary of all the entity's behaviours.
- `listeners` a dictionary of all the entity's listeners.
- `name` the name of the entity.
- `velocity` a 2d vector that contains the current frame x and y velocities respectivly (are set to [0, 0] at every update), the x can be accessed through `self.velocity.x` and y through `self.velocity.y`. 
- `friction_coefficient` this value determines how fast the entity slows down when sliding on surfaces.
- `is_flipped_x` determines if the image is/should be flipped along the x axis
- `is_flipped_y` determines if the image is/should be flipped along the y axis
- `transforms` a list of functions that take a pygame surface and transform it (scale, rotate, etc.)
- `sprite` the pygame image loaded from the entity folder

The entity class also has the following methods:

- `set_x(self, x)` set the x position of the entity.
- `set_y(self, y)` set the y position of the entity.
- `set_width(self, width)` set the width position of the entity.
- `set_height(self, height)` set the height position of the entity.
- `add_listener(self, func_name, callback)` which allows you to define which method (`callback`) to be called with the `func_name` event.
- `remove_listener(self, func_name, callback)` removes that listener from the entity.
- `has_behaviour(self, behaviour_type)` returns True if the entity has a behavior of the given type
- `get_behaviour(self, behaviour_type)` gets the behavior of the given type from the entity if it exist 
- `register_behaviour(self, behaviour)` add a behaviour to the entity.
- `register_behaviours(self, behaviours)` add the `behaviours` list of behaviours to the entity.
- `update(self, delta_time, keys, config, game_methods)` this method is called every frame and updates the state of the entity 
- `update_position(self, delta_time)` moves the entity according to it's current x and y velocities.
- `move_top_to(self, y` moves the entities upmost y position to the `y` position (default same as the y position).
- `get_top(self)` get the upmost y position of the entity (default same as the y position)
- `move_vertical_center_to(self, y)` sets the y position of the entity so that it's vertical center is at the `y` position.
- `move_bottom_to(self, y)` sets the y position of the entity such that the lowest position of the entity is at the `y` position.
- `get_bottom(self)` get the lowest position of the entity.
- `move_left_to(self, x)` sets the x position of the entity such that the leftmost position of the entity is at the `x` position (default same as the x position).
- `get_left(self)` get the leftmost position of the entity (default the x position).
- `move_horizontal_center_to(self, x)` sets the x position such that the center of the entity is at the `x` position.
- `move_right_to(self, x)` sets the x position such that the rightmost part of the entity is at the `x` position.
- `get_right(self)` get the rightmost x position of the entity.
- `get_renderables(self)` returns a list of objects that can be rendered by the camera
- `reset(self)` restores the entity to its original state (kills the entity if it was spawned during gameplay)
- `clear(self)` Removes the entity from the game
- `__del__(self)` Same as `clear(self)`, called automatically when all references to the object are gone.

##### Entities and Behaviours

Some of these methods are used for adding and getting behaviours so for easy reference, to add a new Behaviour to the entity use the `register_behaviour(self, behaviour)` or `register_behaviours(self, behaviours)` methods (generally called from the constructor, \__init\__). For example, to add the fall behaviour to an entity:

```python
from behaviours.Fall import Fall

...

def __init__(self, x, y, name):
   self.register_behaviour(Fall())
```

If you later want to change something to the behaviour you can access it you can use the ```get_behaviour(self, behaviour_name)``` method. For example to change weather an entity with the collide behaviour is a trigger (get's the collision events but otherwise acts like a ghost) you can do like this:

```python
from behaviours.Collide import Collide

...
   self.get_behaviour(Collide).is_trigger = True
```

### Creating new Behaviours

To create a new behaviour you simply need to create a python file in the behaviours folder and make inherit from the behaviour class either directly or through another class. The behaviour class constructor takes an optional `owner` parameter which can be used to set the owner of the behaviour at initialization. The Behaviour class also has the following methods:

 - `set_owner(self, new_owner, delta_time, keys, config)` which sets the owner of the behaviour to the `new_owner`.
 - `update(self, delta_time, keys, config, game_methods)` which by default is called by the base entity class update method once every frame.
 - `get_renderables(self)` returns a list of objects that can be rendered by the camera 
 - `reset(self)` resets the behaviour to its original state

You can read more about how to use behaviours with entities [here](#entities-and-behaviours).

### Changing the UI

The UI is defined by "Views", and each level can optionally have one view associated with it.
To bind a view to a level, you simply have to add `View = ViewName` under the ```[GUI]``` tag in your config.ini. 

All views are located as python scripts in the "views" folder.

Here is an example of a very basic "main menu" view.

```python
from src.gui.elements.button.Button import Button
from src.gui.elements.text.TextBlock import TextBlock

def load_view(gui, game):
    gui.add_gui_element(TextBlock("Welcome to my game!", 100, 100))
    gui.add_gui_element(Button("Start Game", 100, 150, lambda: game.load_level(1)))
```

The name of the view is defined by the name of the view file. So this would be MainMenu.py, and the main menu level would have `View = MainMenu` in its config.

If the view is a pure GUI screen (not a game level), make sure the ```Type``` property under the ```[General]``` tag in the levels config to "Pure GUI" i.e. for the main menu:
```ini
[General]
Name = Main Menu
Type = Pure GUI
Index = 0
[GUI]
View = MainMenu
